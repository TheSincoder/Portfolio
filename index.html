            <p>Sincoder is my callsign, moniker and gamertag. I used to go by 'NobleSerf' to remind myself to lead by serving. As I make my transition into the tech industry, I decided to pick a new name.
                Sin for 'Serf into Noble' as becoming educated in programming gives me more freedom in the job market.

                <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
                                
                <p>I've always been a creative person, and with my creativity I often see the situation in front of me and think: "How can I make this better?" When I started my Airsoft hobby I played
                     with different teams and saw how they ran their events. My creative mind quickly took over and I thought of ways I would run a better team with better events. When I started my team,
                      Black Angels Recon, I needed a website to in order to operate, market and track our events. No one on the team knew how to make websites, so I learned on weebly. I had such a fun time
                       making and upkeeping the website that I made websites for other hobbies and eventually for some friends who were starting side hustles and ran their own hobbies.</p>

                <p>When I started my journey in Sales Leadership I realized that it was difficult to visually track and thus improve upon all the statistics that make up the story of the team. In order to 
                    be a more effective leader I partnered with a colleague to make Excel spreadsheets with complex equations in order accurately track and display the pertinent statistics. This required us
                    to pull from multiple reports, copy and paste and accurately display the statistics in a way that was easy to understand visually for the agents on the team. This allowed every agent to
                    know where they stood and what aspects to improve upon in order to increase sales. This resulted in both my colleague and I having top teams! We shared our calculators with the whole of
                    the company and those teams that utilized it increased sales and those that used other methods were not able to keep up.
                </p>
                <p>This got me thinking...I've been able to work my way up into leadership positions in multiple industries (see Resume), build websites, build excel calculators and utilize my creativity
                    to make my job easier and be more effective. I can learn quickly and understand concepts well. I should look into becoming a programmer! I talked to friends and acquaintances and did hours
                    online research to find the most effective way to learn programming that would work with my work schedule. After narrowing it down to a few programs I landed upon Coding Temple.
                </p>
                <p>At Coding Temple I will be learning Python, Flask, React, HTML, CSS, and SQL. As I've worked my way throught he pre-work I'm beginning to fall in love with the puzzle as I learn
                    more about how to think like a developer. So far my favorite has been HTML as I'm able to flex my creative mind into something visual immediately. I can't wait to learn more and 
                    enter the programming work force to continue to utilize my creativity!

                        niece and nephew a safe space to be themselves, learn about over coming adversity and have fun while doing it!

                        allow for a great environment to help each other develop our creative side!

                        to think ahead about your opponents next move utilize battle field strategies in order to win!

                        people live and think. It's created many timeless memories and helped open our minds and heart to the world!

                        I quickly became a leader in the community starting and running my own team and later joining
                        the top team in Utah, Black Ops Elite. We use it to help Veterans with PTSD, run charity events and teach young kids interested in guns and the military about safety and have fun doing it!
