        <h1>Noble Crow Tournaments</h1>
        <p>Noble Crow Tournaments was a website I built to help run Warhammer Miniatures Game tournaments at local game stores. When the Pandemic hit we stopped doing the tournaments and 
            to save money I took the website offline.

        <h1>Operation Abolitionist</h1>
        <p>boe-our.net is a website I built to help organize, sell tickets and track tickets for the Operation: Abolitionist charity events I ran with my Airsoft Team. We initially ran the event
            with Black Angels Recon, the Airsoft team I started and later with Black Ops Elite, a well established team in the community.

        <h1>Arcane Odyssey</h1>
        <p>Arcane Odyssey is a Dungeons and Dragons style Role-playing Game that
            my older brother and I have been creating. We have kept the same base
            rules of 5th edition but created the entire world including the
            majority of races, classes, spells and abilities. It takes place in
            a universe where we assume the 'aliens' on other planets are elves, 
            dwarves, orcs and more! With Magic and Technology combined, the possibilities
            are endless!
