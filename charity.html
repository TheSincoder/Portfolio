            <h1>Charity</h1>
            <p>I strongly believe in giving back to the community and especially to those that are less fortunate. Here are some of the Charity events I've not only been a part of, but 
                played an integral role in leading, organizing and running the events.

        </h1>
            <body><p>            eHealth Cares is a charity organization for employees who work at eHealth to volunteer for. I've been part of the Leadership team since January 2020 and when I was a new employee
            I volunteered for multiple events. My favorite event has been yearly Sub for Santa where we find families in need, gather donations from the employees and then buy and present
            the gifts to the families. We've taken Valentine's Day cards to retirement homes that we had our employees write out, and helped replant trees at local ski resorts so they don't
            get run over by the skiiers and snowboarders. It has been amazing to help those in need especially during the Covid Pandemic, I was unfortunatelly not able to attend the presenting
            of the gifts this last year, but helped drive donations throughout the busy season. here is a picture from our latest Sub for Santa.

        <h1>Operation: Abolitionist</h1>
            <body><p>When I started my Airsoft Team, Black Angels Recon, we became aware of a non-profit organization Operation Underground Railroad(OUR). Operation Underground Railroad helps rescue
            and rehabilitate children who have become victims of human trafficking. They operate all over the world and educated us on how prevalent human trafficking is in Utah and surrounding
            states. We decided to run a charity Airsoft event called Operation: Abolitionist where 100% of the proceeds go to Operation Underground Railroad. These events took hundreds of our
            personal dollars to put together, we worked with local businesses to help sponsor the events and donate to the raffle and utilized social media and the website I built to market
            the event and sell tickets online. Since 2014 we raised $1,000, $1,400, $1,700, $3,886, $5,010 and $6,290 respectively each year with our largest event having over 250 people!  
            Each year we had a guest speaker that would help educate everyone on what happens, how to protect themselves and their loved ones and ways they can get further involved in helping
            end human trafficking. Below is a picture from our latest event:
